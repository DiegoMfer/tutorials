# Logo Placeholder

To add a logo for your Jupyter Book:

1. Replace this file with an actual `logo.png` image file
2. The logo will appear in the top-left corner of your book
3. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or similar square dimensions
4. PNG format is recommended for best quality

For now, the book will work without a logo, but it's recommended to add one for a professional appearance.
